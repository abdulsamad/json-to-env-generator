## JSON to Env Generator
JSON to Env Generator can be used to convert a JSON to .env with an optional prefix. You can paste a config obj (e.g firebase config) and it will give you the environment variables and javascript reference for values.

> **Note:** Nested objects are not supported atleast as of now.
